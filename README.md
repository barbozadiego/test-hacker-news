# Test React - Hacker News

Technical test consisting of a small responsive web application to demonstrate my abilities with react.

## STACK

You must use the following technologies to build the app:

* The latest version of the frameworks: React or Angular
* HTML/CSS only for building the UI components
* Deployment of the web app on Netlify from your Git repository using the New Site from Git workflow

## API

The web application must request data to the Hackers News public API. The dropdown
selector component should use the URL parameter “query” from the “search by date”

The pagination should be implemented using the “page” URL parameter from this API.

## FUNCTIONALITY

* The selected filter should persist on the local storage
* The favorited posts should persist on the local storage
* The web app is expected to work as a responsive web application
* When clicking on the row, a new tab should be open with the link of the post
* Clicking on the “like button” should not trigger the opening of the post URL link
* When hovering on the row, apply opacity to the entire row and its children (texts, icons, like button, etc)
